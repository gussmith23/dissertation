\hl{
How to incorporate 3LA? 
We don't need the entire story.
Or, we can give a brief intro to the larger story.
}

\hl{sections to pull from 3LA

3LA does fit the story, but it's not really my work byond flexible matching. do i just not incorporate the otehr stuff, then?}

Compiling workloads to accelerators
  is a difficult task---%
  so difficult, in fact,
  that it is often possible
  to publish new accelerator designs
  without ever having run end-to-end
  applications
  on them.
  \hl{figure}
In response to this,
  we built \TLA~\cite{huang2022specialized},
  a methodology for 
  end-to-end
  compilation to and validation of
  machine learning accelerators.
\TLA is effectively
  a case-study for the usefulness
  and effectiveness
  of \g.

\hl{explain the background: set up 3LA}


\hl{definitely include all eval stuff, including finding the bug in flexnlp}

\section{Introduction}

\hl{how is development currently done}

\hl{Give context on 3LA stuff, but it's not the full story.}
