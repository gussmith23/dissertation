\Cref{part:glenside-and-3la} 
  of this dissertation
  is pulled from two publications:
``Pure Tensor Program Rewriting via Access Patterns'' by Smith et.~al.~\cite{smith2021pure} and ``Blah 3LA'' by Huang et.~al.~\cite{huang2022specialized}. \hl{update 3LA citation, make sure}

\chapter*{\Cref{part:glenside-and-3la} Abstract}

\hl{
In this abstract we should capture 
  how this section actually relates
  to the broader thesis.
By the time we get to intro/motivation,
  we should be ready
  to jump into explaining the background
  of 3LA...without calling back to the thesis?
Or should we call back to the thesis there as well?
It seems weird not to,
  but at that point we'll be "in the weeds"

In \cref{part:glenside-and-3la} of this dissertation,
  I describe an application of my underlying thesis
  to the generation of compilers
  for machine learning accelerators.
Specialized hardware, especially for high-performance fields
  such as machine learning,
  have only grown in importance
  over the last decade.
Despite increased focus
  in the generation of new hardware,
  it remains surprisingly difficult
  to test hardware
  as it is being designed.
Testing hardware is crucial
  to delivering a functional product.
In \cref{part:glenside-and-3la},
  I describe how we applied
  my thesis
  when building 3LA,
  a novel methodology
  for building hardware accelerators.
In \cref{sec:part1-background}
  we give related background.
In \cref{sec:part1-motivation},
  we introduce the
  motivation for this part.
In \cref{sec:part1-glenside},
  we introduce \g,
  \hl{a language for equality saturation.}
In \cref{sec:part1-evaluation}
  we present an evaluation.
