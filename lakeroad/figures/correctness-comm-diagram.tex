  \lr Correctness Properties:
  {\small 
  The Synth-Correct Property (left triangle)
    running an \lrir program
    synthesized from a spec $s$
    has the same result
    as running the spec program directly.
  The Compile-Correct Property (right triangle)
    says that
    running an \lrir program
    is the same as compiling it to an HDL
    and simulating the HDL program.
The \lr-Correct Property
  combines the Synth-Correct Property
  and the Compile-Correct Property
  to provide a correctness guarantee for \lr.}}

\hl{fg is not in the diagram---how do we add?}
\hl{above specxsketchxsems, instead we have spec and sems going into that existing node, and sketch being generated by fg}


\hl{Another solution here (maybe what we currently have...) is that we just don't consider sketch generation in correctness, because it doesn't have an effect. then we would need to get rid of sketch generation section and all mentions of fg. we need to make sure to indicate why we can ignore sketch generation}
