\chapter{Broader Thoughts}

Though this dissertation
  is meant to seem like a polished and cohesive
  story,
  the actual path to a PhD is much
  more winding and twisted.
In this section, I want to chronicle
  the higher level thoughts,
  ideas, and inspirations
  underlying the projects in my dissertation
  (and some projects that didn't make it in).
