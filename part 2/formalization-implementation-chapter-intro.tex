\hl{what to actually name this chapter? it would be nice to have parallel structure between part 1 and part2, which would imply that we should name it ``Lakeroad''. that seems kinda weird though.}

Now that we have motivated
  the need for a tool like \lr,
  and have shown how it can improve
  a hardware designer's life in a simple example,
  in this chapter
  we provide the detailed information needed
  to reimplement \lr.
We begin by formalizing \lr
  in \cref{sec:formalization},
  providing a rigorous mathematical description
  of the entire compilation flow.
We then fill in implementation details
  not covered by formalization
  in \cref{sec:implementation}.
